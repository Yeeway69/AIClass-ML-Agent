 A repo for the ML-Agent lab assignment

# How to run (My Final Model Pre-loaded)
The environment is in the scene "SampleScene", it has the Roller Ball setup with my trained model attached and it should show rolling towards the target behavior when you hit play

# To use the environment to train a new model: 
if Python and ML-Agent environment is set up, the training should run with for example: "mlagents-learn config/rollerball_config.yaml --run-id=RollerBall_v6" In Powershell
